# Bootcamp_Projects
This folder contains the projects (Using C++) I made during my winter bootcamp
It consists of 2 projects:
  1. Sudoku Solver
  2. Image rotation using openCV (this is inside RetryCV folder)
  

In Sudoku Solver:
  1. Backtracing techinque is used to implement this
  
  2. We test for each possible value
      2.1 If the value fits the rules, this it is putted in grid
      2.2 Else we backtrack, and repeat the process
      
  3. This code can determine an invalid grid too


Readme file of openCV is inside retryCV folder
